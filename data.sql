-- Database should be prime_feedback

-- Switch to "prime_feedback" before making:
-- Table to store the feedback
CREATE TABLE "feedback" (
  "id" serial primary key,
  "feeling" INT not null,
  "understanding" INT not null,
  "support" INT not null,
  "comments" text,
  "flagged" boolean default false,
  "date" date not null default CURRENT_DATE

-- Sample feedback item
INSERT INTO "feedback" ("feeling", "understanding", "support", "comments")
VALUES (3, 4, 5, 'Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.');
